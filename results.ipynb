Cheers was created by the team of James Burrows, Glen Charles, and Les Charles. The show was set in the eponymous Cheers bar (itself named for the toast \" Cheers\") in Boston, Massachusetts, where a group of locals met to drink and generally have fun. The show's theme song was written and performed by Gary Portnoy with its famous refrain, \"where everybody knows your name\", that also became the show's tagline.\n",
